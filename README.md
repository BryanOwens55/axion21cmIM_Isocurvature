****21cm Intenstiy Mapping with axionCAMB****

This code was written for my Master thesis. It calculates the Fisher matrices for a given 21cm intensity mapping experiment, including the axion fraction as forecasted parameter. 

To get this code running, you need to have a running axionCAMB version installed. Change the CAMB_EXEC to the directory of your axionCAMB executable. 
It is recommended to run this code with the mpi4py-package if one is interested to scan many surveys (and axion masses). 

See my Master thesis for further details.
